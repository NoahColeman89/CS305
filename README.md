•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis financial was creating software for investing money for their clients.  They needed to make sure that all the data was secured with an appropriate algorithm.

•	What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

The thing I did well was picking an algorithm that would be secure and easy to use.  Secure code is important because people are trusting us to keep their data away from potential threats.  Software security adds value to a company by creating trust.  If people trust a company, they will do business with it.

•	What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

Vulnerability assessments are challenging as there are a large number of potential threats to address, and taking the correct approach can be tricky.

•	How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

To increase security layers, I looked for best practices being used, and tried to implement then.  In the future I would follow security practices set forth by trusted security experts.

•	How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I checked to make sure the code was secure by printing vulnerability report.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I found the maven website helpful.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would showcase the server controller and hash function I wrote to produce the cipher.
